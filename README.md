# sqlstitch

`sqlstitch` is a command-line tool that reads SQL files, sorts them based on their foreign key constraints, and prints the sorted SQL statements to the standard output. The output is safe to execute as is, which means it can be directly used to create or modify a database schema.

```shell
$ sqlstitch --help
Usage: sqlstich [OPTIONS] <FILES>...

Arguments:
  <FILES>...  Input files to process

Options:
  -v, --verbose  Prints debug information
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Usage

You can use `sqlstitch` by providing it with one or more SQL files as arguments. Here's the basic usage:

```shell
$ sqlstich <FILES>...
```

For example, if you have a directory named schema containing your SQL files, you can sort all of them and write the output to a new SQL file like this:

```shell
$ sqlstich schema/*.sql > sorted_schema.sql
```

This will create a new file named sorted_schema.sql containing the sorted SQL statements.

## Supported SQL Statements

Currently, `sqlstitch` supports the following SQL statements:

- `CREATE TABLE`: This statement is used to create a new table in a database.
- `CREATE INDEX`: This statement is used to create an index on one or more columns of a table.

Please note that other SQL statements present in the provided files will be ignored by `sqlstitch` in its current version. We are actively working on expanding the list of supported SQL statements. Stay tuned for updates!
